To run the notebook "GDP prediction.ipynb is highly recommended uses a anaconda distribution, using it a highly provable  that all library used are already installed.
If it is not the case bellow there is a list of the ones necessary:

matplotlib - 
numpy
pandas
seaborn
scikitlearn
tkinter


all this library can be install using conda or pip command
to generate the graph of the final model tree GraphViz 2.38 was used, this software can be found in https://graphviz.gitlab.io/
If you only want to see the full tree generate that is in the report it is in the folder of this project as tree.png with all the figures used in the report.pdf
the librarys can be install direct by command - pip install "name of the library listed above"
